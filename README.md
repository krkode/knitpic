# knitpic
converts a picture to a knitting chart

# TODO
MED - make the color of the cell label contrast to the cell color, like what if i have a black cell and black text?
EZ - allow the user to turn the colors off and on in the chart as well
MED - probably should start making test cases now
MED - reconsider key structure. idk if id should be an attribute, does nesting dictionaries make it too complicated? would a lookup table be better?
EZ - display gridlines and row numbers + major quadrants
EZ - allow chart to be downloaded as file (pdf or image i dont care)
EZ - hover over cell in grid to view coordinates
MED - view Y coordinates on either side of chart (even on one side, odd on other)
EZ - view X coordinates on bottom of chart
MED - allow user to put marker in the last row they were on
ADV - allow user to save chart and come back to site, upload working chart (including legend) and keep going/adjust. Did someone say injection attacked?!?!
MED - allow user to change selected colors
        e.x. all reds change to blue
MED - allow user to input length and width the scale pic accordingly
ADV - allow user to input measurements/gauge
MED - display stitch as v not a square
EZ - having a blog page with the projects made from the knitpic function would be cute. like include the generated chart and then the final product, ooo could include the pics in the read me too!
