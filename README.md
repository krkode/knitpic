# knitpic

# TODO
EZ - host as website on github
EZ - take picture as input
EZ - convert picture to color chart
EZ - display gridlines and row numbers
ADV - allow picture to be simplified
EZ - allow chart to be downloaded as pdf
MED - allow user to change selected colors
        e.x. all reds change to blue
MED - allow user to input length and width the scale pic accordingly
ADV - allow user to input measurements/gauge
EZ - having a blog page with the projects made from the knitpic function would be cute. like include the generated chart and then the final product, ooo could include the pics in the read me too!
