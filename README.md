# knitpic
converts a picture to a knitting chart

# TODO
MED - probably should start making test cases now
EZ/MED - label each square which will need key to include the id of each color or maybe make like a lookup with color to id hmmm
EZ - if image is smaller than width allow scale up functionality too
MED - convert picture to color chart
EZ - display gridlines and row numbers + major quadrants
EZ - allow chart to be downloaded as file (pdf or image i dont care)
MED - allow user to change selected colors
        e.x. all reds change to blue
MED - allow user to input length and width the scale pic accordingly
ADV - allow user to input measurements/gauge
MED - display stitch as v not a square
EZ - having a blog page with the projects made from the knitpic function would be cute. like include the generated chart and then the final product, ooo could include the pics in the read me too!
